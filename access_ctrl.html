              Access control systems are the electronic systems that are
              designed to control through a network and they should have an
              access to a network. Access Control System recognizes
              authenticates and authorizes entry of a person to enter into the
              premise thereby giving complete protection ensuring security with
              the system.

            />
            <p>
              The Bio metric Access Control System is a time attendance control
              system with fingerprint access and it tracks and records data of
              Visitors and Employees through its Access Software. This is widely
              used in confidential places for its easy installation and high
              security. Bio metric Access Control System uses fingerprint
              instead of card system for access. The Access Control System not
              only permits entry but also gives the data regarding the entry of
              persons. The Attendance Software can be integrated with any
              existing payroll software and it gives automatic record of
              information generated by the Attendance System and this saves time
              and resources in recording. It increases productivity and
              profitability for any organization.

              suitable for homes, offices and other access control applications.
              Access control systems were typically administered in a central
              location. Besides electronic door locks, there are access control
              panel models, magnetic door locks with uninterrupted power

            <h4>Security Access Control System:</h4>
            <img
              src="https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Security-Access-Control-System.jpg"

            <p>
              There are many options in security access control system for
              example, in a home security system that can be customized to meet
              each individual and family needs and they are burglar alarm
              systems, fire and carbon monoxide detection systems,
              closed-circuit TV video systems, card access and automation
              systems.
              <br />
              The systems consist of sensors placed at different locations
              throughout the house that communicate with a central control unit.
              The control unit is connected to an alarm or to an automatic
              telephone dialer or Internet connection to monitor.
              <br />
              These systems are available as monitored or non-monitored which
              simply activate a loud or flashing alarm attached to the home,
              give homeowners a false sense of security. In a monitored system,
              it is connected to a 24-hour central monitoring service and this
              service receives an intruder signal. The home is called within
              seconds and the person who answers must give their name and the
              pass code whereas in a Non-monitored alarm systems call is set to
              dial the local police directly when the system detects an
              intruder.
              <br />
              A wired security system is connected by low-voltage wires and a
              wireless security system employs tiny radio transmitters which
              transmits signals to the central control unit. All these control
              units have batteries and if there is a power failure or if the
              wires are cut many systems have batteries that automatically
              recharge when the unit is online with the household power.
              <br />
              This is all about access control system and its types which
              provides security by giving flexible control over who is allowed
              to enter your premises. Further any information regarding this
