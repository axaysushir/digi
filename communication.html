              The security and surveillance industry is changing, and solutions
              have moved far past basic alarm monitoring. Live video
              surveillance and other remote security features have increased
              visibility for organizations that want to safeguard their people,
              assets, and buildings. The Internet of Things (IoT) is helping
              create safer cities, homes, and businesses by enabling both
              private and public organizations to securely and remotely monitor
              facilities and public spaces in real-time with smart security and
              surveillance solutions.

              There are various type of CCTV camera systems are availabe like
              dome, bullet type and IP camera which works on network. Night
              vision camera which works perfectly on low light conditions. One
              of the biggest factors driving interest in IP video systems is the
              high resolution that they can offer. Analog cameras max out on
              resolution at about 580 TVL which equates to roughly 0.4 mega
              pixels. High end IP cameras on the other hand, are currently
              available at resolutions above 5 mega pixels.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Dome & Bullet Camera: </strong> This camera is one most
              commonly used for indoor security and surveillance. The shape of
              the camera makes it difficult for onlookers to tell which way the
              camera is facing, which is a strong piece of design, deterring
              criminals by creating an air of uncertainty.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>IP/Network Camera: </strong> IP video cameras broadcast
              their video as a digital stream over an IP network. Like an analog
              system, video is recorded on hard drives, but since the video is
              an IP stream straight from the camera, there is more flexibility
              as to how and where that video is recorded. The DVR is replaced
              with an NVR (network video recorder), which in some cases is just
              software since it doesn't need to convert analog to digital. Video
              footage can then be stored on new or existing network RAID drives
              as directed by the NVR software.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>PTZ Camera :</strong> PTZ – Pan/tilt/zoom – cameras allow
              the camera to be moved left or right (panning), up and down
              (tilting) and even allow the lens to be zoomed closer or farther.
              These cameras are used in situations where a live guard or
              surveillance specialist is there operating the security systems.

              EPABX has proven to be of immense use in communicating within
              office, making routine work simpler. It can be defined as a
              switching system for calls that enables both internal as well as
              external switching functions in an organization. Typically up to
              10,000 subscribers can be accommodated by a single EPABX system.
              PBX systems are private local telephone systems that are used to
              provide telephone service within a building or group of buildings
              in a small geographic area. PBX systems contain small switches and
              advanced call processing features such as speed dialing, call
              transfer, and voice mail. PBX systems connect local telephones
              ("stations") with each other and to the public switched telephone
              network (PSTN).

				<h2>Time Attendance</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Time-Attendance defines productivity of any organization which is inherently human-oriented, complex and challenging to automate. Productivity of any organization depends on its effectiveness in putting the right people in the right place at the right time. No two organizations have identical attendance and leave policies. The same organization may follow different timings and holidays for its different facilities like head office, factory and branch offices. Various departments like manufacturing, R&D and marketing within an office differ in their timings, grace period and overtime calculations. Further, people working at different levels in the same department need different time-attendance flexibility. It is a herculean task to identify a Time-Attendance solution that meets the organization’s exact needs and integrates seamlessly with its existing IT/ERP infrastructure. </p>
